        The mission for Ily's Boutique is to help everyone look fabulous and sophisticated by enjoying every day looks. 
        </p>
            
        <ol>
            <li>1st goal is for the webpage to look fancy and inviting 
            <li>2nd to attract customers
            <li>3rd goal is for my webpage to pop up when customers search for clothing stores
        </ol>    
        <p>
             I choose the CHANEL website because its a famous site for fashionistas. The website is very chicky, to the point, and doesn't have a lot going on. I like the format of the webpage and hope that I can make my site look the same. I think that the setup would be ideal to showcase my latest fashion.
        </p>
        <p>
             The webpage will consist of three pages.
            <h1>1st webpage consists of Fashions for The Season like Summer 2023 Fashions and an option to choose the fall collection. The page will include a clickable tab to chose the type of collection the customer wants to see.
                 
                <p>    
                page 1 will display the type of clothing available for example spring fashion.
                </p>

                <h1>2nd webpage will consist of Summer Collection,a list of styles will be displayed available for the customer to choose from.
                
                <p>
